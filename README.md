# odin-landing-page

TOP landing page project

scope of the project was to replicate a layout from a provided image only;

HTML and CSS is my own, aside from using VS code to do the initialising of the HTML file;
I know that it will not be the most pretty structure, I did reorganise the styles to try to make it readable and to minimise duplicated lines, comments included in the css.

used flex, and I did play around with some media queries to make it somewhat responsive;
